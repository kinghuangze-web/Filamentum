# Website Audit Skill

This skill enables AI agents to audit websites for over 150 rules in 20 categories using the squirrel CLI.

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the `squirrel` CLI to be installed and available in your PATH.

### Windows Installation (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://squirrelscan.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Linux/macOS Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://squirrelscan.com/install | bash
```

## Basic Workflow

1.  **Run the audit**: This saves results to a local database.
    ```bash
    squirrel audit https://example.com
    ```
    *Tips*:
    *   Prefer auditing LIVE websites for true performance representation.
    *   If auditing a local dev server, ensure it's running first.

2.  **Generate Report**: Export the report in LLM-optimized format.
    ```bash
    squirrel report <audit-id> --format llm
    ```
    *Note*: The `<audit-id>` is displayed after the audit completes. You can also list recent audits with `squirrel audit --list`.

## Common Commands

*   **Quick Health Check** (25 pages, no link discovery):
    ```bash
    squirrel audit https://example.com --coverage quick --format llm
    ```
*   **Full Comprehensive Audit** (500 pages):
    ```bash
    squirrel audit https://example.com --coverage full --format llm
    ```

## Taking Action on Results

When interpreting the audit report:
*   **Fix ALL issues**: Critical, high, medium, and low priority.
*   **Parallelize fixes**: Use subagents for bulk content edits (alt text, headings, etc.).
*   **Iterate**: Fix batch -> Re-audit -> Fix remaining -> Re-audit -> Until score > 95.
