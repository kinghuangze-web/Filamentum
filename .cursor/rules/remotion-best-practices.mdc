# Remotion Best Practices

This skill provides domain-specific knowledge for Remotion, a framework for creating videos programmatically with React.

## Core Concepts & Rules

When working with Remotion, refer to these key areas:

*   **3D Content**: Integration with Three.js and React Three Fiber.
*   **Animations**: Fundamental animation patterns (interpolation, springs, easing).
*   **Assets**: Best practices for importing images, videos, audio, and fonts.
*   **Audio**: Handling audio tracks, trimming, volume, speed, and pitch.
*   **Metadata**: Dynamically setting composition duration, dimensions (`calculate-metadata`).
*   **Compositions**: Defining `Composition`, `Still`, folder structures, and props.
*   **Captions**: Displaying captions (TikTok style), importing SRT, or transcribing audio.
*   **Performance**: Using `Freeze` to optimize heavy components.
*   **Rendering**: settings up `renderMedia` or `renderStill`.

## Important Patterns

*   **Tailwind CSS**: Use the `Tailwind` helper or standard PostCSS setup.
*   **Fonts**: properly load fonts using `continueRender` handle or `@remotion/google-fonts`.
*   **Randomness**: Use `random()` from `remotion` instead of `Math.random()` to ensure deterministic rendering.
*   **Absolute Imports**: Prefer absolute imports for assets to avoid path issues during rendering.

## Common Tools

*   `@remotion/media-utils`: For `getAudioDurationInSeconds`, `getVideoMetadata`, etc.
*   `@remotion/paths`: For handling paths correctly.
*   `zod`: For defining schema props in `z.object({})`.
